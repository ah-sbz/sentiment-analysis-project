I absolutely loved every minute of it,1
The pacing dragged and I nearly fell asleep,0
Strong performances and a satisfying ending,1
What a waste of time and money,0
"Heartwarming, clever, and beautifully directed",1
Messy story with terrible dialogue,0
"Fun, uplifting, and worth rewatching",1
Painfully boring and far too predictable,0
One of the best movies I have seen this year,1
I regret watching this,0
